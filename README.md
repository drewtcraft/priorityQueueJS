# priorityQueueJS

### Basic Priority Queue Implementation in JavaScript

Queue must be CREATED using the pushToQueue function - will not accept an array. First element in queue must be blank (implemented with undefined). This queue is set up for sorting with lower numbers as priority.

Will rewrite as class that can implement different types of priority at some point soon.
